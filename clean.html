				<h2>How to Use this Guide</h2>
				<p>The purpose of these guides is to teach you how to preform basic maintenance tasks on
					your personal computer. After reading these guides you should be able to open and
					clean your computer with confidence, knowing that you accomplished these tasks
					yourself instead of having a friend or relative do it, or spend time and money in
					bringing your personal computer into a computer repair shop.</p>
				<p>To use these guides, simply continue reading through the rest of the guide and
					follow along with the steps as you complete the tasks (if you can have this page
					open while you are working on your computer while it is unplugged,) or print this
					page out and follow the steps as listed then save the guide for later use if needed.</p>
				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<p>In this guide you will learn how to safely clean the inside of your computer case. We
					recommend following our guide on how to open up you computer case if you have not
					yet opened it up. If you do not feel comfortable opening up your personal computer
					(voiding the warranty) then this guide does not have much to offer you.</p>
				<p>What you will need:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A computer</li>
					<li>A hand screwdiver</li>
					<li>A flashlight</li>
					<li>A can of compressed air</li>
					<li>A camera, or paper and a pencil/pen</li>
					<li>A slightly damp paper towel</li>
					<li>A well-ventilated area</li>
					<li>The ability to lift at least twenty pounds</li>
					<li>A sense of adventure</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Move Computer to Well-Ventilated Area</li>
					<li>Discharge Static Electricity</li>
					<li>Open Computer Case</li>
					<li>Inspect the Inside</li>
					<li>Remove Dust</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>The Procedure</h2>

							<h3>Move Computer to Well-Ventilated Area</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="computer on table" src="guide10.jpg">
								<figcaption>We assume that you have followed the guide to opening your
									computer and know at least that much. <span class="it">It is important
									to move your computer case to a well-ventilated area to allow the
									compressed air (which is not actually air and is extremely lethal if
									inhaled) to dissipate. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INHALE THE COMPRESSED AIR!
									</span> This also helps to clear the dust from your computer case.</figcaption>

							<h3>Discharge Static Electricity</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="discharging static electricity" src="guide4.jpg">
								<figcaption>Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is an enemy of electronics and
									your computer is no exception. <span class="it">Don't skip this step!
									Avoid frying your expensive computer by touching a metallic surface,
									even the outside of your computer case will work while it is plugged
									in.</span> Your computer case offers grounding protection: it redirects
									electronically harmful amounts of electricity away from the electronics
									inside and into the ground (dirt.)</figcaption>

							<h3>Open Computer Case</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="inside of computer case" src="guide13.jpg">
								<figcaption>Remove the thumb screws at the back of your computer case along
									the right side. Pop the side panel off and set it aside. Many computer
									cases' side panels come free by sliding the panel toward the back of
									the case then come off at an angle. <span class="it">Try to play around
									with different methods of removing the side panel if this is not the
									case, but do not try to force the side panel off.</span></figcaption>

							<h3>Inspect the Inside</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="closer view inside computer case" src="guide14.jpg">
								<figcaption>Look around the inside of the case for any visible signs of
									damage. These include scorch marks, damaged components, and anything
									else that might seem suspect to you. <span class="it">Recall that
									electrostatic discharge is the enemy of electronics. Do not touch any
									components on the inside of your computer case with you hands! Not only
									can you damage the sensitive electronics with static electricity, but
									you will transfer natural oil produced by your skin onto the circuit
									boards and components that causes them to start to break down.</span>
									If you do see signs of damage, bring your computer into a computer
									repair shop to have an expert look at it.</figcaption>

							<h3>Remove Dust</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="removing dust using can of compressed air" src="guide15.jpg">
								<figcaption>Follow the directions on the can of compressed air for use.
									<span class="it">DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INHALE THE COMPRESSED AIR! Remember
									to not touch the components directly with your hand.</span> If the can
									starts to feel cold, set the can down and let it warm back up. After
									finishing removing the dust from the inside of the computer case. Take
									slightly damp paper towel (run the water over a paper towel and wring
									it out thoughly,) and run it over all the exterior surfaces of the
									computer case except the indented portions of the back of the case
									(where all the cables plug into.) Once that is complete you are ready
									to put the side panel and thumb screws back in place and get your
									computer plugged in again.</figcaption>

				<h2>The End Result</h2>
				<p>In this guide you learned how to safely clean the inside of your computer case. You
					learned about the safety precautions to take when dealing with computer hardware and
					how to mitigate those problems. Congratulations, you have taken the next steps toward
					becoming more computer savvy and literate! Well down!</p>
