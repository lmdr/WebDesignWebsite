Web Design and Development I Course Project

Copyright 2016 Louis Duller

The files within this repository were the result of a final project for the first of a sequence of two web design and development courses. The project goal was to access students' comprehension and retention of the semantically correct use of HTML5 capabilities through a number of requirements. Such requirements were a minimum number of webpages, website title, navigation, and content utilizing appropriately different HTML elements. All assignments throughout the course were typed out (no Dreamweaver here - it doesn't always produce elegant and semantically correct HTML code anyway). The topic of the website was left to students to determine. When completed, students were to upload their files to a web server to host the website at a domain they had setup previously.

The topic chosen was a website offering DIY computer repair/maintenance guides to follow. The two guides offered on the website could be used on their own, but were best if one follows the use of the other. Nearly five years on, the tone of the content is not likely what I would take today. Considering extensibility for a hypthetical website like this would be punishing for the editor if they had to custom write every additional webpage - mistakes would eventually show, even for the most stoically meticulous. This type of content would be better delivered by a weblog that offers a toolset built for increased productivity.
