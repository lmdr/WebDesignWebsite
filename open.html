				<h2>How to Use this Guide</h2>
				<p>The purpose of these guides is to teach you how to preform basic maintenance tasks on
					your personal computer. After reading these guides you should be able to open and
					clean your computer with confidence, knowing that you accomplished these tasks
					yourself instead of having a friend or relative do it, or spend time and money in
					bringing your personal computer into a computer repair shop.</p>
				<p>To use these guides, simply continue reading through the rest of the guide and
					follow along with the steps as you complete the tasks (if you can have this page
					open while you are working on your computer while it is unplugged,) or print this
					page out and follow the steps as listed then save the guide for later use if needed.</p>
				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<p>In this guide you will learn how to safely unplug and open your computer case. If you
					do not feel comfortable opening up your personal computer (voiding the warranty) then
					this guide does not have much to offer you.</p>
				<p>What you will need:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A computer</li>
					<li>A hand screwdiver</li>
					<li>A flashlight</li>
					<li>A camera, or paper and a pencil/pen</li>
					<li>The ability to lift at least twenty pounds</li>
					<li>A sense of adventure</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Save Your Work</li>
					<li>Turn Off Computer</li>
					<li>Safely Move to Back of Computer Case</li>
					<li>Discharge Static Electricity</li>
					<li>Locate Power Cable</li>

				<h2>The Procedure</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Save Your Work</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="saving work" src="guide1.jpg">
								<figcaption>We all hate it when our computers lock up and force us to
									restart. Its even worse when working on something important. However,
									this time around we have a chance to save our work before we shut down
									our computer. It helps to save often anyway.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Turn Off Computer</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="turning off computer from start menu" src="guide2.jpg">
								<figcaption>Turn off your computer by using the system appropriate
									method for beginning the shut down procedures on your computer.
									For example, on computers running Microsoft Windows, the option to
									shut down is found in the start menu (the button in the lower-left
									corner of the screen in standard desktop arrangements.)</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Safely Move to Back of Computer Case</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="back of computer case" src="guide3.jpg">
								<figcaption>Once your computer has shut down we can begin this step. We
									need to get to the back of the computer case so we can unplug all of
									the cables that make all the things run. <span class="it">It is
									important to keep your safety in mind when doing this, especially if
									your computer is in a hard to reach place.</span></figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Discharge Static Electricity</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="discharging static electricity" src="guide4.jpg">
								<figcaption>Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is an enemy of electronics and
									your computer is no exception. <span class="it">Don't skip this step!
									Avoid frying your expensive computer by touching a metallic surface,
									even the outside of your computer case will work while it is plugged
									in.</span> Your computer case offers grounding protection: it redirects
									electronically harmful amounts of electricity away from the electronics
									inside and into the ground (dirt.)</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Locate Power Cable</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="power cable" src="guide5.jpg">
								<figcaption>The power cable is generally a large, black, and fairly
									unflexible cable that connects from a wall power outlet or a power
									strip to your computer case to provide it the power it needs to run.
									The cable has a large amount of insulation on the outside and hefty
									end connector plugs. <span class="it">Beware of cracks or splits in
									the power cable. These are gaps in the insulation of the power cable
									that can expose you to dangerous levels of current. Do not proceed any
									further with this guide and replace the power cable immediately!</span>
									Locate the end of the power cable that plugs into your computer case.
									This will give you a good idea of where the power supply is located in
									your computer case.</figcaption>
							</figure>

					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Flip Switch on Power Supply to Off Position</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="power supply switch" src="guide6.jpg">
								<figcaption><span class="it">We recommend taking a picture of what things
									look like on the back of your computer case, specifically where cables
									are plugged in to the computer. If you cannot take a picture then
									take a piece of paper and draw where things are plugged in.</span>
									By flipping the switch on the back of your power supply to the off
									position, you still get the potection of the grounding but you do not
									have to worry about power flowing into your computer.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Start Gently Removing Peripheral Cables</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="removing peripheral cables" src="guide7.jpg">
								<figcaption>Start removing the cables other than the power cable (we will
									remove that one last.) <span class="it">Always pull the cable out using
									the connector - never pull a cable out using the cable itself. If the
									cable does not slide out with minimal effort, do not force it out. Try
									inspecting the cable connector for a locking or latching mechanism and
									then unlock or unlatch it before pulling it out using the connector.</span></figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Remove Power Cable</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="removing power cable" src="guide8.jpg">
								<figcaption>Now for the last cable. Remove the power cable by pulling on
									the connector.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Carefully Slide Computer Away from Desk</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="computer away from desk" src="guide9.jpg">
								<figcaption>Time to come up for some air and slide the computer out from it
									spot under the desk. Grasp sturdy points on the computer case and pull
									toward you to dislodge it from its spot. <span class="it">Take care not
									to force the computer out of its spot too hastily to avoid scratching
									the paint on the computer case or damaging the delicate hardware
									inside (or damaging your desk.)</span></figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Set Computer Down on Hard Surface</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="computer on table" src="guide10.jpg">
								<figcaption><span class="it">Its time for more physical activity. If you
									do not feel comfortable lifting at least twenty pounds please ask for
									assistance. Make sure to lift with your legs rather than your back - 
									squat rather than bend your back to lift.</span> Recall that
									electrostatic discharge is the enemy of electronics. Gently put the
									computer down on a hard surface like a hardwood floor in a place where
									you can reach the computer case with comfort. <span class="it">Be sure
									to discharge any static that you may have built up on a metallic
									surface other than your computer case this time (remember its not
									plugged in anymore - that static electricity has no where to go.)</span></figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Locate Back of Computer Case</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="back and side panel of computer case" src="guide11.jpg">
								<figcaption>This should be fairly easy - its the side of the computer case
									you removed all those cables from earlier.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Remove Thumb Screws</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="thumb screws holding side panel in place" src="guide12.jpg">
								<figcaption>Remove the two screws on the back of the computer case toward
									the right side. There should be a screw toward the top-right and a
									screw toward the bottom-right. <span class="it">While many computer
									cases are fitted in this way, using screws to secure the side panel,
									not all are. If your's differs then you will have to figure out how to
									open your computer case up.</span></figcaption>
							</figure>
						</article>
					</li>
					<li>
						<article>
							<h3>Open Computer Case</h3>
							<figure>
								<img alt="inside of computer case" src="guide13.jpg">
								<figcaption>Finally, we arrive at the end at long last. The side panel may
									have popped free already in which case it just did that work for you!
									Otherwise, you will have to open it up. Many computer cases' side
									panels come free by sliding the panel toward the back of the case then
									come off at an angle. <span class="it">Try to play around with
									different methods of removing the side panel if this is not the case,
									but do not try to force the side panel off.</span> Once you are ready
									to put your computer back in place follow the steps in this guide
									backwards.</figcaption>
